# Specification Quality Checklist: Operator Observability Console

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding
to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all checklist items.
- The specification intentionally describes robust workload membership and
  bounded observation as product outcomes; collector, UI toolkit, storage, and
  formal-model implementation choices remain planning concerns.
- Existing full-fidelity local audit and the new presentation-safe workload
  activity store are separate contracts, avoiding an implicit change to the
  constitution's current local-audit fidelity rule.
